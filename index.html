    <h1>PsySH</h1>

    <p>
      PsySH is a runtime developer console and debugger for PHP. Unlike
      <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.interactive.php"><code>php -a</code></a>, PsySH is a
      <abbr title="Read-Eval-Print Loop">REPL</abbr>, does automatic semicolon insertion, and is really hard to crash.
      In addition to working as a REPL, PsySH can be used as a debugger, much like javascript's <code>debugger</code> statement,
      saving you from the pain of endless <code>var_dump()</code> and <code>die()</code> iterations.
    </p>

    <p>
      For an overview of the state of PHP debugging and why PsySH might be for you, see the slides from
      <a href="https://presentate.com/bobthecow/talks/php-for-pirates">Interactive Debugging in PHP</a> at OSCON 2013.

<section id="install">
  <h2>Installation</h2>

  <p>
    PsySH <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/psy/psysh">is available via Composer</a>, or you can use it directly
    from <a href="https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh">the GitHub repository</a>:
  </p>

  <pre>
    git clone https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh.git
    cd psysh
    ./bin/psysh
  </pre>

  <p>But by far the easiest way to use it is to download the precompiled phar:</p>

  <pre>
    wget psysh.org/psysh
    chmod +x psysh
    ./psysh
  </pre>
</section>

<section id="configure">
  <h2>Configuration</h2>

  <p>While PsySH strives to detect the right settings automatically, you might want to configure it yourself. Just add a file to `~/.psysh/rc.php`:</p>

  <pre>
  &lt;?php

  return array(
      // In PHP 5.4+, PsySH will default to your `cli.pager` ini setting. If this
      // is not set, it falls back to `less`. It is recommended that you set up
      // `cli.pager` in your `php.ini` with your preferred output pager.
      //
      // If you are running PHP 5.3, or if you want to use a different pager only
      // for Psy shell sessions, you can override it here.
      'pager' => 'more',

      // By default, PsySH will use a 'forking' execution loop if pcntl is
      // installed. This is by far the best way to use it, but you can override
      // the default by explicitly enabling or disabling this functionality here.
      'usePcntl' => false,

      // PsySH uses readline if you have it installed, because interactive input
      // is pretty awful without it. But you can explicitly disable it if you hate
      // yourself or something.
      'useReadline' => false,

      // "Default includes" will be included once at the beginning of every PsySH
      // session. This is a good place to add autoloaders for your favorite
      // libraries.
      'defaultIncludes' => array(
          __DIR__.'/include/bootstrap.php',
      ),

      // While PsySH ships with a bunch of great commands, it's possible to add
      // your own for even more awesome. Any Psy command added here will be
      // available in your Psy shell sessions.
      'commands' => array(
          // The `parse` command is a command used in the development of PsySH.
          // Given a string of PHP code, it pretty-prints the
          // [PHP Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) parse tree. It
          // prolly won't be super useful for most of you, but it's there if you
          // want to play :)
          new \Psy\Command\ParseCommand,
      ),
  );
  </pre>

  <h2>Usage</h2>

  <h3>PsySH as a REPL</h3>

  <p>
    PsySH functions as a <abbr title="Read-Eval-Print Loop">REPL</abbr> for PHP right out of the box! Once you've
    <a href="#install">downloaded the phar file</a>, running it directly (./psysh) will drop you into an interactive prompt,
    like so:
  </p>

  <pre>
    ~/psysh/bin$ ./psysh
    Psy Shell v0.1.0-dev (PHP 5.4.9-4ubuntu2.2 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman
    >>>
  </pre>

  <p>
    From here, you can start entering PHP code and see the result interactively:
  </p>

  <pre>
    >>> function timesFive($x) {
    ... $result = $x * 5;
    ... return $result;
    ... }
    => null
    >>> timesFive(10);
    => 50
    >>>
  </pre>

  <h3>PsySH as a Debugger</h3>

  <p>
    To use this functionality, drop the psysh phar file into your project, include it:
  </p>

  <pre>
    &lt;?php
    require('psysh');
  </pre>

  <p>
    Then, drop this line into your script where you'd like to have a breakpoint:
  </p>

  <pre>
    \Psy\Shell::debug(get_defined_vars());
  </pre>

  <p>
    When your script reaches this point, execution will be suspended and you'll be dropped into a PsySH shell. Your program state is
    loaded and available for you to inspect and experiment with.
